        <h2>Problem Description</h2>
    
        <h4>The Medical School Hunt</h4>
            Medical School is a path that many students hope to pursue as they begin their college career. Often times undergraduate students set off on a 
        pre-med path in their early college career with little guidance and/or with harsh guidance from school counselors to pursue other careers if 
        their grades or portfolio is lacking. Since anecdotal stories like such travel quickly, students determined to make their own path and find their 
         own way to med school often hunt for information themselves rather than talking to a counselor.  The process of gathering such information can be
        tedious and confusing.

            The problem that I am to address is the ease of looking up information about medical school. Medical School is already a 
        difficult path to pursue but finding out where to apply to, what is needed to apply, the cost of attendance and the odds of being accepted can even 
        make the choice of pursuing the path more daunting.  To ease the decision-making process for students, and to ease the overall process of determining 
        if Medical School is a correct choice for a student, an application or website in which students could cross compare Medical School requirements as
        well as input information of their own to help filter out choices would be helpful.

        <h2>App Description</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Who are the users of the application? That is, who will be accessing the website?
                <ul>
                    <li>Students and Individuals that are curious about Medical School and its baggage will be accessing the website. </li>
    
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What kind of information will the users be viewing? If you're drawing data form an external source (a csv file or an API), include a link and citation to that data.
                <ul>
                    <li>Users will be viewing various information regarding Medical School such as cost, requirements, odds of acceptance etc. This information can be found online but is usually found on independent websites of each school. There are some websites that allow for Medical School Comparison but they are not optimized. </li>

                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>What will the users do with the web app? What kind of interactions are you expecting to provide?
                <ul>
                    <li>The intention of the web app is to help an individual decide if Medical School is a good path for them based on whatever needs/requirements that are important to them. Users should be able to interact with the web app by inputting information such as their own GPA, their budget range, their program or area of interest within Medical School, their completed prerequisites etc. </li>
            
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>How will using this app help to solve your chosen problem? That is, how is it a solution to the problem you described?
                <ul>
                    <li>This app should help eliminate the problem of having to search for Medical School Information independently. The app should be able to gather all the necessary and pertinent information about Medical School in once place so students can decide on what path they should venture on and to also compare Medical School based on parameters that they can decide on (cost, location, program, acceptance rates etc.). </li>
                
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
